On terminal of your downloaded path input:

## See what I study and implements of RxSwift+MVVM

You will saw some named prefix of 'rx_' of properties and methods. But it's not mean you should do also, it's just let me see which one was refactor to RxSwift use.
You can find what did I do in the files:
```
MaskListViewModel.swift
MaskListViewController.swift
MaskListApiService.swift
URLSessionProtocol.swift
ApiServiceProtocol.swift
```

And how I wrote about unit-test with RxSwift and RxTest in the: 
```
MockApiService.swift
MaskListViewModelTests.swift
```
